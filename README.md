# Python_Crash_Course
A course that taught me to think like a computer scientist. This way of thinking combines some of the best features of mathematics, engineering, and natural science. Like mathematicians, computer scientists use formal languages to denote ideas (specifically computations). Like engineers, they design things, assembling components into systems and evaluating tradeoffs among alternatives. Like scientists, they observe the behavior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions.

## Topics
Structured programming concepts such as:
- Variables, making decisions, looping
- Lists, tuples
- File handling and applications
- Modularization techniques
- Python standard libraries and modules

Basic object oriented programming concepts such as:
- class and object, data attributes, methods, __ init __ (), abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Learning Outcomes
1. Demonstrate the programming concepts.
2. Explain high level language programming structures.
3. Explain algorithm development.
4. Program in Python to solve typical engineering problems and to analyze data.
5. Use Python to generate high quality technical plots (x y plot, contour plot, etc.) that can be incorporated into technical reports.
